# I'm a Senior Solutions Engineer at Signant Health where I bridge business and technical needs by leveraging my background in data automation and computer science. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Building data-driven and AI-enabled tools with Python.
- Exploring LLM integrations and API-based workflows with Claude code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** Python, C++, Java, SQL, JavaScript
- **Data & Analytics:** Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, Sklearn, SciPy, Tensorflow
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Jira, Workfront
- **APIs & Automation:** REST APIs, data pipelines
- **Cloud & Platforms:** AWS (basic), SaaS integrations

## 📌 Featured Projects:
**Samsung AI Capstone Project: (https://sic.edc.org/ai-course/)** Identifying Deepfakes in Medical Imagery with Supervised Machine Learning
- Our capstone project aimed to create, train, and test a Supervised Classification Machine Learning model that could detect the presence of cancer in medical imagery if the tumor found in the image was classified as benign or malignant; and then afterward determine if the image was manipulated. We researched different image classification techniques to establish which machine learning models had better statistical metrics. We decided to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on our thorough evaluation and testing. The SVM model resulted in high precision, having the algorithm return more relevant results than irrelevant ones, with an accuracy of 86%.
