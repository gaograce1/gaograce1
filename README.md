# Hi, I'm Grace 👋

Senior Solutions Engineer at Signant Health with experience designing and implementing data-driven solutions in highly regulated environments (clinical trials, enterprise systems).

I enjoy bridging the gap between business and technical needs by leveraging my background in data automation and computer science. 


## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** Python, C++, Java, SQL, JavaScript
- **Data & Analytics:** Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, Sklearn, SciPy, Tensorflow
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Jira, Workfront
- **APIs & Automation:** REST APIs, data pipelines
- **Cloud & Platforms:** AWS (basic), SaaS integrations


## 📌 Featured Projects:
**Salk Research Institute:** Blood Vessel Detection Algorithm in ImageJ Macro
- In order to analyze the role of glial cells within the central nervous system, I needed to develop a script that could quantify a stimulus reaction in the background of spinal cord video data. I engineered a script that could automate the detection of blood vessels by pixelating the video data and measuring visual distinctions by testing multiple thresholds to determine the specific regions of interest. This automated ImageJ Macro script expedited the data cleaning process and provided a consistent method of quantifying video data from a stimulus.


**Samsung AI Capstone Project: (https://sic.edc.org/ai-course/)** Identifying Deepfakes in Medical Imagery with Supervised Machine Learning
- Our capstone project aimed to create, train, and test a Supervised Classification Machine Learning model that could detect the presence of cancer in medical imagery if the tumor found in the image was classified as benign or malignant; and then afterward determine if the image was manipulated. We researched different image classification techniques to establish which machine learning models had better statistical metrics. We decided to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on our thorough evaluation and testing. The SVM model resulted in high precision, having the algorithm return more relevant results than irrelevant ones, with an accuracy of 86%.
